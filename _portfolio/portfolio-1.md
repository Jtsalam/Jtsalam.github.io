title: "Driver Drowsiness Detection System: AI Bootcamp Project"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/Project_Presentation.jpeg' width='150' align='left' >
As part of my work at [RAIN](https://rainigeria.com/), I developed a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision techniques to monitor eye and mouth aspect ratios with OpenCV. The system triggers an audio alert via pygame when signs of drowsiness exceed a threshold, helping prevent fatigue-related accidents among overnight drivers transporting goods across cities in Nigeria. This Python-based solution demonstrates practical AI application with potential for deployment on edge devices. Currently pursuing funding from the Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP) for next-stage development.<br/>
