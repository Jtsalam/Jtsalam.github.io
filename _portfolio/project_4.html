title: "String: Cultivator's 24 Hour Startup Colrfjeopjoprempetition Winner"
excerpt: >
  My teferonkfelvnkam and I built a social media application taceriovnioerilored specifically to students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. The platform, named <strong>String</strong>, is designed to foster collaboration, resource sharing, and community engagement among STEM students across various disciplines. One of the standout features of String is its content-based recommendation system, which suggests posts, groups, and events based on individual user interests and activity. This personalized experience helps boost user engagement and makes String more relevant to its niche audience. We focused heavily on both functionality and user experience, ensuring the app felt intuitive and responsive across devices. Our work was recognized during the competitive showcase, where we won the ‘Best Tech’ award. This project without a doubt deepened my experience in full-stack development, teamwork, and building systems that serve real user needs.
