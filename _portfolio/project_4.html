title: "CalenDue: 1st Place, Co.Hack 2025 by Co.Labs"
excerpt: >
  CalenDue is an AI productivity tool that automatically parses course syllabi into structured events across Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Canvas, helping students effortlessly organize their semester schedules.<br/><br/> I used Claude Sonnet 4 for text extraction and Clerk for user authentication. I also enhanced the file uploader to support multiple syllabi uploads, implemented a “handle conflict” feature for overlapping events, added color-coded themes for priority differentiation, and integrated a Supabase–Prisma database to persist user data across sessions and devices.<br/><br/> CalenDue won first place at the Co.Labs Co.Hack Hackathon, where it was recognized for its practical impact on student productivity.
