title: "AI-Powered Stock Price Forecaster â€” Independent Project"
excerpt: "I built a web-based application that leverages Facebook Prophet and historical stock data to forecast price trends for companies like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Using yfinance for real-time data and pre-trained models stored as .pkl files, the app provides forward-looking insights such as projected highs/lows, best trading days, trend percentages, and investment recommendations.
The system is deployed with Flask and a simple HTML interface, enabling users to select stock tickers, exchanges, and forecast durations. This project showcases the use of machine learning in financial markets to support smarter investment decisions. <br/>
