I am currently in my second year of my Computer Science degree at the University of Saskatchewan with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence.

My interests lie in making full stack Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning solutions through the combination of robust engineering and through AI research. I'm always Fascinated by how AI solutions can be used to solve problems in my immediate environment.

I am also Fortunate to be the Chair of the [Artificial Intelligence Saskatchewan Student Network](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7296044913526247425/)- a student subsudiary of [AiSK](https://www.aisk.ca/), Our goal is to create an ecosystem for students in post-secondary institutions all over Saskatchewan who have a keen interest for the rapidly evolving space of Artificial Intelligence. My role to play in this goal lies in organizing technical workshops, and events to engage and inform students about the technical and practical aspects of AI.

I've also enjoyed participating in hackathonsâ€”one standout experience was the [Cultivator's 24-Hour Startup Hackathon](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294478916356911104/), where my team and I won 'Best Tech' for developing a social media app powered by content-based recommendation algorithms to boost user engagement.

Outside of this, I'm a passionate [Saxophonist](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTrHHpleJyHqA7N7Fnz1Dw?app=desktop), a cuber and a Devoted [football fan](https://www.manutd.com/en)!
