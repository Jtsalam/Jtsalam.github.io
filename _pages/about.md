I'm currently in my third year pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Saskatchewan, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. It's been a rewarding journey so far, diving deep into the theory behind computation while also exploring how to build systems that learn, adapt, and make decisions.

My passion lies in building full-stack Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning solutions that blend solid software engineering with practical AI research. I'm constantly fascinated by how these technologies can be applied to solve real-world problems, especially those that directly affect my community and the people around me.

Iâ€™m also fortunate to serve as the Chair of the [Artificial Intelligence Saskatchewan Student Network](https://www.aisk.ca/student-network)- a student-led subsidiary of [AiSK](https://www.aisk.ca/), Our mission is to build a thriving ecosystem of AI enthusiasts across post-secondary institutions in Saskatchewan. Through workshops, technical events, and community engagement, we aim to connect students with the fast-evolving AI landscape.

As Chair, I take on the responsibility of organizing events that inspire students to go beyond textbooks; events that expose them to the practical, hands-on side of AI. From foundational topics to cutting-edge tools, I love seeing peers grow confident in building their own projects and asking big questions about the future of tech.

One highlight of my journey so far has been participating in hackathons. A memorable one was the [Cultivator's 24-Hour Startup Hackathon](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294478916356911104/), where my team and I won 'Best Tech' for developing a social media app powered by content-based recommendation algorithms to boost user engagement.

Outside the world of code and AI, I'm a passionate Saxophonist who enjoys creating music that moves people. Whether it's jazz, gospel, or something in between, playing the sax is one of the ways I recharge and express creativity in a completely different form. Enjoy this [clip](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/N_jOKUltCCY) of me playing Beautiful things by Benson Boone.

When Iâ€™m not coding or making music, youâ€™ll probably find me solving Rubikâ€™s cubes or passionately supporting my favorite football team, [Manchester United](https://www.manutd.com/en)! I believe in bringing the same focus, energy, and joy from my hobbies into everything I do including building tech that matters.
